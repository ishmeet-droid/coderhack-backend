# Leaderboard API for Coding Platform

## Introduction
This project implements a RESTful API service using Spring Boot to manage a leaderboard for a coding platform. Users compete and earn badges based on their achieved scores.

## Technologies Used
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data MongoDB
- JUnit5 (for testing)

## Features
The API offers functionalities for:
- User Registration: Register new users with a [Unique ID (AutoGenerated)} username.
- User Retrieval: Retrieve a list of all registered users, sorted by score (highest to lowest). Retrieve details of a specific user by their ID.
- User Update: Update a user's score, automatically updating their badges based on predefined criteria.
- User Deletion: Deregister a user from the leaderboard.

## API Endpoints
| Method | URL                        | Description                                                               |
|--------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GET    |/coderhack/users            | Retrieves a list of all registered users sorted by score (descending).    |
| GET    | /coderhack/users/{userId}  | Retrieves a specific user by their unique ID.                             |
| POST   |/coderhack/users            | Registers a new user to the coding platform leaderboard.                  |
| PUT    | /coderhack/users/{userId}  | Updates the score of a specific user, adjusting their badges accordingly. |
| DELETE | /coderhack/users/{userId}  | Deregisters a user from the leaderboard, removing their entry.            |

Note: {userId} is a path variable representing the unique user identifier.

## Data Model
The system utilizes a User entity with the following fields:
- userId (String): A unique identifier for the user.
- username (String): The username of the contestant.
- score (Integer): The user's achieved score in the contest (between 0 and 100).
- badges (Set<Badges>): A set of badges awarded based on the score (Code Ninja, Code Champ, Code Master). A user can have a maximum of three unique badges.
  
**Note: Badges is enum defined**

## Badge Awarding Criteria
- 1 <= Score < 30 -> Code Ninja
- 30 <= Score < 60 -> Code Champ
- 60 <= Score <= 100 -> Code Master

## Validation and Error Handling
The API implements basic validation for user input (e.g., ensuring score is within range) and returns appropriate HTTP error codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found) for invalid data or errors.

## Testing
JUnit5 tests are included to verify the functionalities of the API service.
